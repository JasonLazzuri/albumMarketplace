<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Astral's mission is to make money selling music that is not horrible, or if it is horrible, is horrible in weird and interesting ways...or it is a best seller and will make us a lot of money(we are a <em>store</em> after all)</p>

<p>Our name does not mean we are a cosmic hippy music store- though you may find some hippy music here- it refers to our creator's ego. One can only name so many things "Star ____", so we turned to a thesaurus.</p>
