# Planning

2. Specs
As a user, when I start the game, I would like to be able to add characteristics about myself, so I feel more connected to the role I am playing.
As a user, I want to read a description of my current surroundings and scenario, so I may determine what I'd like to do in response.
As a user, I want to be able to select from at least 2 options at the end each scenario, so I may take a unique path and have a different experience than a different user.
As a user, I would like my choices to affect my points, so I can tell if I am winning or not.
As a user, I want to be able to see my current points at any given time.
As a user, I want to be informed that I've lost if my points go beyond a minimum level.
